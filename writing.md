## Writing Guidelines
- Structure: logical progression from familiar to new concepts
- Engagement: start with hooks, 
- Style: no bold/italic for emphasis, no emojis, simple punctuation
- Quality: every sentence advances the main point, include specific examples
- Pyramid principle: lead with the answer, then support it
- Show, don't just tell; use concrete examples and numbers
- Specific over general; name the thing precisely
- Strong verbs and concrete nouns; avoid weak adverbs and qualifiers
- Active voice by default; passive only when actor is unknown or irrelevant
- Cut filler: remove hedges, weasel words, and redundancies
- Parallelism: keep list items grammatically parallel and ordered by logic
- Transitions: repeat key terms to bridge paragraphs and maintain flow
- Headline test: promise a clear benefit or idea
- Curiosity gap: pose a question, withhold just enough to pull the reader
- Structure patterns: problem → tension → resolution; before → after → bridge; goal → obstacle → method → result
- Edit passes: structure, clarity, rhythm, mechanics
- Reader tests: 12-year-old test, skim test, last-sentence completeness test
- Stop rule: end when the promise is delivered
- Link related notes with brief context using [[Note]] references
- One idea per note; keep notes short and findable
## Structure and Sequencing
- art of order: arrange information from familiar to new, general to specific, simple to complex.
- CRIBS: a compact paragraph shape, e.g., claim, reason, illustration, benefit, summary.
- write an essay: pursue a question to a thesis through clear steps.
## Cohesion and Flow
- idea sequence: let each sentence set up the next so momentum never breaks.
## Openings and Closings
- no ceremonial introduction: skip throat clearing; start where the value starts.
- end on a high: finish with the strongest line or clearest takeaway.
## Rhetorical Devices and Tension
- anaphora: repeat an opening phrase across sentences to build rhythm and emphasis.
- foreshadowing: plant early hints that prepare later turns and reward attention.
- the curiosity gap: pose a question or partial pattern that pulls the reader forward.
- keep them in suspense: delay key information to create tension, then resolve cleanly.
## Audience and Framing
- priming: prepare the reader with context and vocabulary so the point lands.
- write timeless essays: favor evergreen problems and principles over the news cycle.
## Clarity and Style
- write like you talk: simple, direct, conversational language.
- art of sentence length: mix short and long sentences to control pace and focus attention.
## Evidence and Argumentation
- be specific: use concrete nouns, numbers, names, and examples instead of abstractions.
- don’t equivocate: use one precise term for one idea; avoid vague synonyms that blur meaning.
- understate rather than overstate: let facts carry weight; avoid hype.
- polemic writing: take a clear position, bring evidence, and answer the best counterarguments.
## Voice and Stance
- be great soul: write from a generous, principled stance that serves the reader and the truth.
- gonzo journalism: write from inside the scene, first person, with subjective honesty.
## Showing and Imagery
- visualize your writing: make the reader see with imagery and specific detail.
- explain emotions with behavior: show actions, dialogue, and sensory details instead of labels.
- emotional writing is powerful: ground arguments in felt experience so they stick.
## Scope and Focus
- necessary and sufficient: state the minimal conditions, and do not add extras.
- doesn’t matter if it’s interesting: cut anything that does not advance the point or promise.
## Information Hygiene
- succinctness is power: compression increases clarity and force.
## Editing and Revision
- the ugly first draft: draft fast to find ideas, then edit hard for clarity.
## Storytelling
### Core Principles
- a story is a weapon: stories change beliefs and coordinate action; use them carefully.
- storytelling monkey: the brain craves narrative, so wrap facts in a clear, causal story.
### Narrative Arcs and Patterns
- good stories are well-structured: hook, conflict, stakes, turn, resolution, change.
- normal => explosion => new normal: status quo, disruption, and the transformed state.
### Openings and Closings
- start with a story: open with a concrete scene that embodies the thesis.
